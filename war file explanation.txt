The WAR file acts as a binary if you drop it into your JSP engine webapps folder. 
It also contains the Java source code. When you place it in your running Tomcat 
(or whatever) it will expand, and you can examine the source code in the appropriate
 subdirectory of WEB-INF/classes.

You can also extract files from the WAR file just as you would from any other zip file. 
The WAR is just a zip file with a different extension. There is no functional difference 
in the internal format. On Windows you can use the Winzip executable to examine the contents
 of a WAR file. The Linux command-line equivalent is gubzip.
